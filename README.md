# Stupid Static Site Generator

This is a bash script that is wrapped around pandoc. This script
can be used to make those hip static sites that are all the rage.
You probably should not be using this.


# Requirments

* pandoc
* common *nix tools like sed, awk, etc
* self hate and a desire to punish yourself


# Usage

Either use the template(s) that I stole from write.as, or make your 
own. Since this POS uses pandoc, any template that works with 
pandoc _should_ work with this (but probably not). Put some markdown
files in the `drafts` folder and run `build.sh`. Done.
